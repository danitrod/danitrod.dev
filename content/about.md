I'm a software engineer that weared many hats in a short span of time, having experienced developer
advocacy, cloud development, front end, back end, and tech lead roles, over the course of 5 years.
I've started my career working
with [IBM](https://ibm.com), as an intern and subsequentially regular employee, using mainly Python,
Rust, and React for many different innovative projects with their partners.
I then worked for a couple of years with [Dock](https://dock.tech), where I developed
low latency REST APIs with Golang for ther Banking as a Service ecosystem, applying domain driven design.
And currently, I'm working with [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/), a B2B insurance San Francisco
startup, where I'm helping them implement a microservice-oriented architecture using Golang.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently applying to start my master's
in the field of high performance and distributed computing. As for other interests, I'm a solo traveler,
Vipassana meditator, musician, and chess player ([invite me for a match!](https://www.chess.com/member/danitrod)). And
I use Neovim, by the way.
