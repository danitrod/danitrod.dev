I'm a software engineer focusing on the financial industry, currently working in the backend of a
Banking as a Service solution. I've started my career working with [IBM](https://ibm.com), passing
by developer advocate, cloud native developer and tech lead roles, using mainly Python, Rust, and
React. Currently I'm working with [Dock](https://dock.tech), where I develop low latency REST APIs
with Golang, and apply domain driven design to prototype new solutions.
