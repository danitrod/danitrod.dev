Hey — I'm a software engineer based in São Paulo - Brazil, though I tend to move around quite a bit.
I like building clean, reliable systems and thinking through how things fit together — whether
that’s in code, infrastructure, or architecture.

This blog is a mix of notes, experiments, and workarounds I’ve written down after hitting problems
I couldn’t find clear answers to. Most of it was written for my future self, but if it helps you
too, that’s even better.
